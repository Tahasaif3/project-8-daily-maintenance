# Dreaming Loop - State

## Proposals made

### 2026-08-15 review
Reviewed all progress.md entries (2026-08-09 through 2026-08-15, first
review since state was `none`).

Repeated failure found: `project-5-codify-body` gathering failed with a
`gh api` 403 rate-limit error right after listing commits, on
2026-08-10, 2026-08-12, and 2026-08-14 (3 occurrences, identical
signature, always handled by skipping the repo with no retry). Proposed
fix: added a single 60s-wait-and-retry to daily-digest SKILL.md step 2
before falling back to the existing skip-and-continue behavior.

One-off, not proposed as a rule change: 2026-08-14 NOTES.md commit had
a typo ("mainatenance"); happened exactly once, no pattern.

Rule deletion: none proposed. Every rule in daily-digest SKILL.md
(read spine, gather, draft, check draft, write quiet/new, stop-without-
writing on unclean failure) was load-bearing across the reviewed
period - including step 6's stop-without-writing path, which is the
safety net for total gathering failure or a malformed spine and simply
hasn't fired yet, not a rule that's unneeded.
